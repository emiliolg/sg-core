# Enums

An Enum is a special data type that enables for a field to have a value belonging to a set of predefined constants. See Enums MetaModel.

They are very similar to Java enums, they have a set of Keys with associated labels. In fact, at compilation time, a Java enum is generated.

I18n is supported for the labels. Additionally enums may have attributes. These attributes can be of any primitive type.
