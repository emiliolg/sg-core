# Internationalization

Form messages can be internationalized using resources.
A resource file is used for each Form, using FormName_language.properties name.
For each message used in the Form, a Key in the properties file is needed with id equivalent to trimming the Form message.

## Using Idea Plugin
When using the Idea Plugin, keys for messages used in the Forms are automatically generated when "Localize Meta Model" option is chose.

###Settings
I18n settings can be found in Preferences -> Other Settings -> MM Internationalize Settings.
Default language and other languages can be configured from **Language** tab. And automatic translation can be configured from the  **Set Keys** tab.
