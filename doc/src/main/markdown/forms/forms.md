# Forms

In a Sui Generis environment, where entities represent the data model stored in database, forms are used to present that data to the user. Such data can come from entities stored in the database or from other available sources. Forms can be bounded to an entity, and as we will see later, the framework takes advantage of this.

As entities have attributes, forms are defined using widgets. Widgets are defined by an id, a type and a widget type.
They can be bound to an entity's attribute, in which case the type is inhered. If no widget type is defined or no type is defined it is inferred from the other.
The value of these widgets will in all of these cases be a Sui Generis supported type (see [Types](../language/basicTypes.html#types)).
# Example
For the entity:
@inline-code(doc/samples/snippets/src/main/mm/tekgenesis/snippets/Person.mm#person)
The form:
@inline-code(doc/samples/snippets/src/main/mm/tekgenesis/snippets/Person.mm#personForm)

Forms are the standard interactive way to read, create, update, and delete entities. They can also be used without been bound to an entity, as a program entry point, or as a service.

As with entities, the metamodel language allows specifying model options when defining a form. 

##Form Binding
In the above example, a binding between the *PersonForm* and *Person* entity is specified. As mentioned before, forms come in different flavors: binding an entity, with default implementation, with specified primary key, and listing entities. More on this will be covered later on Form Flavors.

The same way entities are composed by attributes of different types, forms are composed by widgets. In the above example we found a header with a nested message widget, an horizontal widget with nested *firstName* and *lastName* bound attribute widgets, and widgets for bound attributes *ssn*, *birthday*, and *gender*. Finally, a footer widget containing buttons of type save, cancel, and delete.

# Widgets

Every form is composed by a set of widgets. All widgets have an id, a widget type and/or a type. If a widget type is not explicitly declared, is inferred from type. Widgets have several field options to customize, extend, limit, transform, decorate, or style the resulting form user experience.
@inline-code(doc/samples/doc-project/src/main/mm/tekgenesis/doc/Samples.mm#summary)

Widget with id summary, label "Summary", type String, and widget type text_field inferred from type.

## Widget Types

Sui Generis offers a wide variety of widget types to be used on form definitions. Most commonly used widget types include *text_field*, *button*, *combo_box*, *display*, *suggest_box*, *internal* and *table*.

Internal widgets have no visual representation on the form user interface. These widgets are convenient for ids, codes, flags, and other internal form data that is not intended to be shown to the final user.


Other widget types include [anchor](widgets/widgets.html#anchor), [breadcrumb](widgets/widgets.html#breadcrumb), [button](widgets/widgets.html#button), [check_box](widgets/widgets.html#checkbox), [check_box_group](widgets/widgets.html#checkboxgroup),  [color_picker](widgets/widgets.html#colorpicker), [combo_box](widgets/widgets.html#combobox), [combo_date_box](widgets/widgets.html#combodatebox), [date_box](widgets/widgets.html#datebox), [date_picker](widgets/widgets.html#datepicker), [date_time_box](widgets/widgets.html#datetimebox), [dialog](widgets/widgets.html#dialog), [display](widgets/widgets.html#display), [double_date_box](widgets/widgets.html#doubledatebox), drag_list, [dropdown](widgets/widgets.html#dropdown), [dynamic](widgets/widgets.html#dynamic),  [footer](widgets/widgets.html#footer), [gallery](widgets/widgets.html#gallery), [header](widgets/widgets.html#header), [horizontal](widgets/widgets.html#horizontal), [image](widgets/widgets.html#image), [internal](widgets/widgets.html#internal), [label](widgets/widgets.html#label), [list_box](widgets/widgets.html#listbox), [mail_field](widgets/widgets.html#mailfield) , [message](widgets/widgets.html#message), [password_field](widgets/widgets.html#passwordfield), [popover](widgets/widgets.html#popover),[PickList](widgets/widgets.html#picklist), [progress](widgets/widgets.html#progress), [radio_group](widgets/widgets.html#radiogroup), range, range_value, [rich_text_area](widgets/widgets.html#richtextarea), [search_box](widgets/widgets.html#searchbox), [showcase](widgets/widgets.html#showcase), [suggest_box](widgets/widgets.html#suggestbox), [tags](widgets/widgets.html#tags), [tags_combo_box](widgets/widgets.html#tagscombobox), [tags_suggest_box](widgets/widgets.html#tagssuggestbox), [text_area](widgets/widgets.html#textarea), [text_field](widgets/widgets.html#textfield), [time_picker](widgets/widgets.html#timepicker), [toggle_button](widgets/widgets.html#togglebutton), [upload](widgets/widgets.html#upload), [vertical](widgets/widgets.html#vertical) and [video](widgets/widgets.html#video)â€¨.

Multiple widgets such as [table](tables/tables.html), [chart](other_multiples/other_multiples.html#chart), [section](other_multiples/other_multiples.html#section), [map](other_multiples/other_multiples.html#maps), and scroll_section are described later.
Other such as subform and tabs, tree_view.

## Widget Type Inference

Widget type inference refers to the automatic widget type deduction in metamodel language. Specifying the attribute type for a widget, a widget type is automatically inferred.

|Type|Inferred widget type|
|----|--------------------|
|String|*text_field*|
|String(144)|*text_area* (for Strings of length 40 or above)|
|Int|*text_field* (numeric, int format)|
|Real|*text_field* (numeric, real format)|
|Decimal(10,2)|*text_field* (numeric, decimal format matching scale)|
|DateTime|*date_time_box*|
|Date|*date_box*|
|Enum|*combo_box*|
|Entity|suggest_box|
|Entity*|*table* (for bound multiple attributes)|
|Resource|*upload*|

## Widget Binding

When a form is bound to an entity, widgets can be bound to any entity attribute. Binding a widget to an attribute comes with great benefits: id, label, and type are all inherited from the binding, and code for model to view, view to model is automatically generated. More on this is covered in the [Generated Code](#generated-code) section.
From the above form example:

```
form PersonForm "Person" : Person
{
...
	firstName; // id, label, and type are inherited from attribute. Widget type text_field is inferred from inherited String type.
	lastName; // id, label, and type are inherited from attribute. Widget type text_field is inferred from inherited String type.	
...
	ssn, display; // id, label, and type are inherited from attribute. Inferred widget type text_field is overridden by specified display.
	birth "Date of birth" : birthday, date_picker; // id, label, and widget type are specified. Inferred widget type date_box is overridden by specified date_picker.
	gender "Gender" : sex; // id and label are specified. Widget type combo_box is inferred from inherited Sex enum type.
...
}
```

When a widget is Bound to an attribute, the id, label and type are inherited. Since widget type can be inferred from type, declaration becomes greatly simplified.

# Model Options

These options are defined at form level, where the formId and label are specified.


|Option|Usage|Description|
|------|-----|-----------|
|**primary_key** |primary_key *aField, another*|Tells which fields are part of form's primary key. Defaults to entity's primary key when bounded to an entity if not specified. If not bounded, part of form's calling url is passed here.|
|**on_display** |on_display *displayMethod* |Invoke *displayMethod* when form is displayed. Called every time form is displayed.|
|**on_schedule** |on_schedule *scheduleMethod 5* |Invoke scheduleMethod repeatedly, with the defined interval in seconds upon finish loading and displaying a form.|
|**on_route** |on_route */someRoute* |Path where the form is going to be served. More on this later on ... (Link to Routing?).|
|**permissions** |permissions *permission1, permission2* |Form's specific permissions. More on this later on ... (Link to Authorization? Forbidden?).|
|**parameters** |parameters *aField, another* |Fields that will act as forms's parameters when invoking a Form as a Service. More on this later on ... (Link to Form as a Service?).|
|**handler** | handler HandlerClass |Allows overriding for the default form handler.|
|**project** | project ProjectName |Defines the project name for this form.|
|**unrestricted** | unrestricted | Makes this form to be always accesible, no matter which permissions the user has.|

## Deprecated model options
|Option|Usage|Description|Replacement|
|------|-----|-----------|-----------|
|**on_load** |on_load *loadMethod* |Invoke *loadMethod* when form is loaded. Called only once per form instance.|Override the load() method|
|**on_cancel** |on_cancel *cancelMethod* |Invoke *cancelMethod* when form is canceled.|Override the cancel() method|

# Generated Code
As mentioned in the [Metamodel Language Section](../language/metamodels.html#code-generation), for each Form a base class and a user class are generated.
The user class will be named as the Form, and the base class will have the same name with the "base" suffix.
If tables or other multiple widgets are used, a base and a user class  are also created as inner classes of the top-level base and user classes respectively.  

## Base Class
Base class includes all generated getter and setter methods. These methods will be named as get or set widget id (if widget has no id, setter and getter will not be genereated.). Setter methods return the model to enforce a fluent API.
 
Some of the methods generated in the base class are the following:

|Method|Usage|
|------|-----|
|**addListener** **removeListener**| To register and remove form listeners. (See [Listeners](listeners.md))|
|**isDefined (Field)**| Returns true if the field value is not null.|
|**reset(Field..)**| Resets the specified fields.|
|**focus(Field)**| Gives focus to the specified field.| 
|**message(Field)**| to allow marking a field with a message.|
|**label(Field)**| to obtain the internationalized label for the specified field.| 
 
Also **populate** method is always created, but if form is not entity based, the method will be final, not allowing the user to override it, and throwing and exception. Populate methods is invoked when populating a form instance

When the form is based on an entity delete, update, create methods are generated. 
**Find** method will also be generated, if base entity has no primary key, it will be generated as abstract, forcing the user class to implement. 


## User Class
User class should include all the methods invoked from on_click, on_change and other field options.
Furthermore, the user class can include overriding of inherited methods, to change behavior. 
 

### Lifecycle interaction methods
To interact in the forms lifecycle the following methods can be overridden. This methods are not generated they are from FormInstance class.
For full method listing See [Sui Generis API Documentation](../javadoc/index.html) for base class tekgenesis.form.FormInstance. 

|Method|Usage|
|------|-----|
|public void load() |*loadMethod* is invoked when form is loaded. Called only once per form instance.|
|public Action cancel()| *cancelMethod* is invoked when form is canceled.|
see [lifecycle](lifecycle.html) for further information on these methods.

# Field Options

Widgets in forms have a different type options.
First the more common options are shown, then more particular ones and to which widgets apply.

## Options for value widgets

Value widgets are the ones that can gain a value. Some examples are text_field, date_box, suggest_box, tags.
These are all the options available for value widgets.

|Option|Usage|Description|
|------|-----|-----------|
|**default** |default *value* |Specifies the default value of the widget. This value will be set and displayed initially and users can modify it freely|
|**is** |is *value* |Specifies which **is** the value of the widget. The value for this widget cannot be modified later by the user. Useful when a widget's value depends on other widget's value. @todo (see calculated example )|
|**disable** |disable when *condition* |Disables the widget when a condition is satisfied. Disabled widgets are greyed out, their values cannot be modified, and all behavior is deactivated.|
|**hide** |hide when *condition* |Hides the widget when a condition is satisfied. Hidden widgets retain their values in the model.|
|**reset** |disable/hide when *condition*, reset |Reset works in conjunction with disable and hide options. When the condition its satisfied, besides hiding or disabling, the widget is reset to its initial state. If reset is applied to a Group widget, it will automatically reset all its internal widgets as well.|
|**depends_on** |depends_on *aField* |Defines dependant/dependee relations between widgets. In that way, if a widget changes its value, all the the dependants widget are reset to their initial state. @todo (see sample depends_on)|
|**check** |check *condition* : [inline] [warning] "message" | Checks for a condition and displays a message (error by default) in the widget. It appears as a balloon over the widget when the widget gains focus, use inline modifier if you want the tooltip to be placed near the widget. Forms that have errors cannot be submitted.|
|**skip_tab** |skip_tab |Widgets with this option will not gain focus when tabbing accross the page with the TAB key.|
|**placeholder** |placeholder *"placeholder text"* |The text defined by this option will be used as a placeholder text in the widget. This text is not set as value for the widget, it is shown as a visual hint. It can be an expression.|
|**on_change** |on_change *changedMethod* |Invoke method *changeMethod* when the widget's value changes. Fired when the value changes from the widget and from the model using the setter method.|
|**on_ui_change** |on_ui_change *uiChangedMethod* |Invoke method *uiChangeMethod* when the widget's value changes. Fired only when value changes from the widget (UI).|
|**on_blur** |on_blur *bluredMethod* |Invoke *bluredMethod* when widget looses focus.|
|**multiple** | multiple |Mutates a value widget to a multi valued one. Accessors will receive and return a collection of the specified type.|
|**abstract_invocation** |delegates invocation on containing form|Abstract invocation works in conjunction with on_change, on_ui_change, on_blur, and on_click options. Action performed on widget is delegated to containing form (that implements all subforms abstract invocations) or ignored.|
