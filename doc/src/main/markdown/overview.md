# Sui Generis

Sui Generis is a Rapid Application Development tool. Rapid Application Development (RAD) is a software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. The *planning* of software developed using RAD is interleaved with writing the software itself. The lack of extensive pre-planning generally allows software to be written much faster, and makes it easier to change requirements.  
Sui Generis basic architecture consists on a set of development tools focused on developers productivity. Sui Generis takes care of the infrastructure so the user can focus on the application. It's designed from the ground to handle huge amounts of data, web and mobile compliant, and all this being database independent.  
Takes advantage of Object Oriented concepts and Agile methodologies: fast prototyping and incremental improvement to more complex systems.
